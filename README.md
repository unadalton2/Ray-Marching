# Ray Marching
Experimenting with using ray marching to render signed distance functions in Unity.
This is just a test project, so beware! It is very unoptimized and incomplete.
See orginal project video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp5WWtMoeKg

To run this project you'll need to open it in the Unity game engine: https://unity3d.com/
